# Validators

Anyone can become a validator on Canto. In exchange for securing the network, validators can charge a percentage fee of their choosing on [staking rewards](../../user-guides/staking.md) distributed to their delegators.

This section contains instructions on how to launch a validator node, as well as information and best practices on troubleshooting, slashing, and ensuring node uptime.

For community troubleshooting and assistance, see the #builders-chat channel in the [Canto Discord](https://discord.gg/canto).

## Hosted Nodes

As an alternative to setting up and syncing a Canto node independently, dedicated validating nodes can be easily provisioned with [Ansybl](https://www.ansybl.io/).
