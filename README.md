# What Is Canto?

[Canto](https://canto.io/) is a permissionless general-purpose blockchain running the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was built to deliver on the promise of DeFi – that through a post-traditional financial movement, new systems will be made accessible, transparent, decentralized, and free.

At launch, Canto provides [Tendermint consensus](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html) secured by [Canto validator nodes](technical-reference/validators/) and an EVM execution layer via [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) in addition to core financial primitives designed to support the [Free Public Infrastructure (FPI)](https://canto.gitbook.io/canto/welcome/how-does-canto-work/free-public-infrastructure-fpi). These primitives include:&#x20;

* [Canto DEX](overview/canto-dex-and-lp-interface.md) — a zero-fee DEX for liquidity providers
* [Canto Lending Market (CLM)](overview/canto-lending-market-clm.md) — a pooled lending Compound v2 fork
* [$NOTE](overview/note.md) — a fully collateralized unit of account token issued by the CLM which also serves the ecosystem as a USDC/USDT soft-pegged stablecoin

**Over time we expect this stack to change significantly and new financial primitives to be added to best fulfil the Canto mission.**

## Core Tenets

Canto’s goal is to become the best execution layer for original work. Canto accomplishes this in three ways:

**Liquidity as a Free Public Good:**

Zero fees for Liquidity Providers (LPs). Canto makes liquidity free for protocols, arbitrageurs and traders.

**Rent Extraction Resistant:**

Canto aims to establish Free Public Infrastructure. Core DeFi primitives will not have sovereign governance tokens, nor the capacity to extract rent in the future.&#x20;

**Minimal Viable User Capture:**

Where possible, Canto avoids interface-driven user ownership. Public infrastructure DEXes will have no swapping interface, so all users must trade on third-party aggregators. This will facilitate user acquisition for new protocols.

## Approach to Decentralization

Canto is designed to support free public infrastructure, while eliminating centralized incentives:

* There is no official foundation.&#x20;
* There was no presale.&#x20;
* There is no vesting.
* There are no venture backers.&#x20;

## Community Engagement

Canto is a distributed community of DeFi advocates for a free public infrastructure.

Though the initial Canto contributors have created the following resources for Canto announcements and details, **** there are no official Canto channels or branding assets, as any Canto community member can create resources, channels, imagery and discussion on Canto.&#x20;
