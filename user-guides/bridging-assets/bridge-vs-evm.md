# Bridge and EVM

**There are two Canto ledgers: the Canto Bridge and the Canto EVM.** Depending on what you want to do on Canto, you may need to convert assets from one chain to the other**.**

If you have just bridged from Ethereum or Cosmos, your assets are on the Canto Bridge blockchain. To use the Canto Lending Market, Canto DEX, and other DApps, you must bridge your assets to the Canto EVM.

If your assets are already on the Canto EVM but you would like to bridge them back to Ethereum or Cosmos, you must first bridge them to the Canto Bridge blockchain.

{% hint style="info" %}
**To bridge assets between the Canto Bridge and Canto EVM, you must have at least 2.3 $CANTO in your MetaMask wallet.** If necessary, you can request a drip from the #social-faucet channel in the [Canto Discord](https://discord.com/invite/canto).
