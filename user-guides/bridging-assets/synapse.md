# Synapse Bridge (Multichain)

[Synapse Bridge](https://synapseprotocol.com/) is a multichain bridge that enables on-chain asset swaps between Canto and 10+ other blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and others.

## Using Synapse Bridge

The Synapse bridging process is identical regardless of whether you are bridging to or from Canto. To use the bridge, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [**https://synapseprotocol.com/**](https://synapseprotocol.com/) **** and connect your wallet.
2. Under the _Origin_ section, select the network you would like to bridge from, as well as the asset you would like to send and its amount.
3. Under the _Dest._ section, select the network you would like to bridge to (e.g. Canto) and the asset you would like to receive.
4. If necessary, click the _Approve_ button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to approve the outgoing asset.
5. Finally, click the _Bridge_ button and confirm the transaction in your wallet to initiate the bridging process.

## Supported Assets

Synapse supports bridging to and from the following assets on Canto:

* [$NOTE](https://app.gitbook.com/o/UXyuOCE75UxaFcpPBpJt/s/K4o1JDSaOKhM0C8tixAv/\~/changes/OSEXXP2u9colSeWeYDu1/overview/note) – Canto's native unit of account
* [$nUSD](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/reference/faq#synapse-bridge) – Synapse's stablecoin bridge asset
* [$SYN](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/reference/faq#the-syn-token) – Synapse's governance and incentive token

Users can bridge to and from stablecoins $USDC, $USDT, and $DAI on other chains, but they are automatically converted to/from $nUSD or $NOTE on Canto.

### Sponsored Liquidity Pool

Early contributors propose the Canto DAO sponsor a $nUSD <> $NOTE liquidity pool, enabling deep liquidity between traditional stablecoins on other chains and Canto's native unit of account. For more information, see the [Canto Stableswap Pool](https://synapseprotocol.com/pools/canto2pool) on Synapse.
