# Bridging Assets

The [Canto Bridge](https://bridge.canto.io/) allows you to bridge assets to Canto from Ethereum or Cosmos Hub. It also supports bridging back to Ethereum.

The following pages contain step-by-step instructions for bridging:

* [Ethereum <-> Canto](ethereum.md)
* [Cosmos Hub -> Canto](cosmos.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Canto Bridge transfers assets to and from the native Canto chain, not the Canto EVM. To move assets between them, see [Converting Assets](../converting-assets.md).
