# Bridging Assets

The [Canto Bridge](https://canto.io/bridge) allows you to bridge assets to Canto from Ethereum or Cosmos Hub. It also supports bridging back to Ethereum.

The following pages contain step-by-step instructions for bridging:

* [Ethereum <-> Canto](broken-reference)
* [Cosmos Hub -> Canto](broken-reference)
* [Gravity Bridge <-> Canto](broken-reference)
* [Synapse Bridge (Multichain)](synapse.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Canto Bridge transfers assets to and from the native Canto chain, not the Canto EVM. To move assets between them, see [Converting Assets](broken-reference).
