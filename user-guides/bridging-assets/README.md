# Bridging Assets

## Canto.io

The [**canto.io/bridge**](https://canto.io/bridge) frontend allows you to bridge assets in and out of Canto from Ethereum, Cosmos Hub, and other IBC-enabled chains. Under the hood, it is powered by Gravity Bridge, LayerZero, and IBC, depending on the asset being bridged.

For more information about using the frontend, see the following pages:

* [Bridging to Canto](to-canto.md)
* [Bridging from Canto](from-canto.md)

## Third-Party Bridges

Various third-party bridges also support bridging directly to the Canto EVM:

* [Synapse Bridge](synapse.md)
* [Celer cBridge](celer.md)
