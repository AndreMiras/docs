# Converting Assets

**There are two Canto ledgers: native Canto and the Canto EVM.** Depending on what you want to do on Canto, you may need to convert assets from one chain to the other**.**

If you have just bridged from Ethereum or Cosmos, your assets are on the native Canto blockchain. To use the Canto Lending Market, Canto DEX, and other DApps, you must convert your assets to the Canto EVM:

* [Native Canto -> Canto EVM](converting-assets.md#canto-native-greater-than-canto-evm)

If your assets are already on the Canto EVM but you would like to bridge them back to Ethereum or Cosmos, you must first convert them to the native Canto blockchain:

* [Canto EVM -> Native Canto](converting-assets.md#canto-evm-greater-than-canto-native)
