# Providing Liquidity

The Canto LP Interface allows users to provide liquidity and receive LP tokens. The Canto LP Interface does not allow users to swap tokens; rather that must be done on a third-party site such as [Slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/ETH).&#x20;

When users land on the site, they will see all available pools to provide liquidity for. To begin with, Canto will go live with 5 pools; Canto/Note, Canto/Eth, Canto/Atom, Note/USDC, and Note/USDT. In the table, the asset, TVL, current wallet's position and % share of the pool will be displayed.
