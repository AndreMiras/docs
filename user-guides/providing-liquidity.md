# Providing Liquidity

The Canto LP interface at [**canto.io/lp**](https://canto.io/lp) allows users to provide liquidity and receive LP tokens. At launch, Canto has six incentivized liquidity pools which can be found on this page:

* CANTO/NOTE
* CANTO/ETH
* CANTO/ATOM
* NOTE/USDC
* NOTE/USDT
* cNOTE/USDC

{% hint style="info" %}
The Canto LP interface does not allow users to swap tokens through the Canto DEX. To interact with the Canto DEX, use a third-party frontend or aggregator such as [Slingshot](https://app.slingshot.finance/trade/ETH).
