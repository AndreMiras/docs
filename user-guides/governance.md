# Governance

The Canto governance page is a place where all users who have staked Canto can vote on proposals. This allows you to contribute to the blockchain and place votes on changes that will directly impact the Canto community.&#x20;

### Proposals

When entering the governance page, a list of all completed and ongoing proposals are shown. The title of the proposal, start time, end time, and a bar representing the current votes is shown in each block. For more information on each proposal, click on the proposal and a modal will open. &#x20;
